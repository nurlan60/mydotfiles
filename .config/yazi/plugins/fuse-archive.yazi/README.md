[fuse-archive.yazi](https://github.com/boydaihungst/fuse-archive.yazi)
uses [fuse-archive](https://github.com/google/fuse-archive) to
transparently mount and unmount archives in read-only mode, allowing you to
navigate inside, view, and extract individual or groups of files.

There is another plugin on which this one is based,
[archivemount.yazi](https://github.com/AnirudhG07/archivemount.yazi). It
mounts archives with read and and write permissions. The main problem is it uses
[archivemount](https://github.com/cybernoid/archivemount) which is much slower
than [fuse-archive](https://github.com/google/fuse-archive).
It also supports very few file types compared to this plugin, and you need to
mount and unmount the archives manually.

[fuse-archive.yazi](https://github.com/boydaihungst/fuse-archive.yazi) supports mounting the following file extensions: [SUPPORTED ARCHIVE FORMATS](https://github.com/google/fuse-archive?tab=readme-ov-file#archive-formats)

## What news with this fork

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Minimum version: yazi v25.5.31.
>
> Password-protected RAR file is not supported yet!

### Keep the file mount

By using `plugin fuse-archive -- leave`. So you can copy and paste
the content to other place without open a new tab

### Support multiple deep mount

That mean, if you have a file like below,
just use the `plugin fuse-archive -- mount` to go deeper inside
and `plugin fuse-archive -- leave` to go back. Even if the files inside are password-protected,
it will still prompt you to enter a password. You only need to enter the password once for each file.

- Origin file.zip
  - Child_1.zip
    - Grandchild_1.zip
  - Child_2.zip (with password)
    - Grandchild_2.zip (with another password)
      - GranGrandchild_3.zip (with another password)

### Support mountoptions

You can use `plugin fuse-archive -- mount` with mount options. Add `mount_options` option to `setup()` function.

### Exclude extensions

Using `excluded_extensions` option, you can exclude some extensions from mounting.

### Support MacOS

This plugin supports MacOS, but you need to install `macfuse` instead of `fuse3`.

## Requirements

1. [yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi).

2. This plugin only supports Linux and MacOS, and requires having latest
   [fuse-archive](https://github.com/google/fuse-archive), [xxHash](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash) and `fuse3` for linux, and [macfuse](https://github.com/macfuse/macfuse/releases) for macOS installed.
   This fork requires you to build and install fuse-archive with latest
   source from github (because the latest released version in some distros is too old, 2020).

## Installation

### Dependencies:

- For Ubuntu:

  Use `libfuse3-dev` instead of `libfuse-dev` if you are using Ubuntu 22.04 or later.

  - libfuse-dev: This is for FUSE 2.x, the older version.
  - libfuse3-dev: This is for FUSE 3.x, the newer and actively developed version.
    which is recommended by fuse-archive's author.

  ```sh
  sudo apt install git cmake g++ pkg-config libfuse3-dev libarchive-dev libboost-all-dev xxhash fuse3
  git clone https://github.com/google/fuse-archive
  cd "fuse-archive"
  sudo make install
  ```

- For Arch based:

  ```sh
  yay -S xxhash fuse3 fuse-archive

  # or: paru -S xxhash fuse3 fuse-archive

  # Or: install fuse-archive from source:
  # git clone https://github.com/google/fuse-archive
  # cd "fuse-archive"
  # sudo make install
  ```

- For other distros, it's better to use ChatGPT for dependencies. Prompt: `install fuse-archive YOUR_DISTRO_NAME`.

- For macOS (only for fuse-archive >= v1.14):

  - You can install `macfuse` and `xxhash` with `brew install macfuse xxhash`.
  - Then install `fuse-archive`:

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/google/fuse-archive
  cd "fuse-archive"
  sudo CXXFLAGS=-DFUSE_DARWIN_ENABLE_EXTENSIONS=0 make STD=gnu++20a install
  ```

- Fuse-archive also relies on the availability of the following filter programs: `base64`, `brotli`, `compress`, `lrzip`, `lzop` and `grzip` for supporting those compression formats.

### fuse-archive.yazi:

```sh
ya pkg add boydaihungst/fuse-archive
```

Modify your `~/.config/yazi/init.lua` to include:

```lua
require("fuse-archive"):setup()
```

### Setup options

The plugin supports the following options, which can be assigned during setup:

1. (optional) `smart_enter`: If `true`, when _entering_ a file it will be _opened_, while
   directories will always be _entered_. The default value is `false`.

2. (optional) `excluded_extensions`: A list of extensions that will be excluded from mounting.

3. (optional) `extra_extensions`: A list of extensions to add to the supported mount list.
   This is useful if you want to mount an archive format that I may have missed or unawared it is supported by fuse-archive.

4. (optional) `mount_options`: String of mount options to be used when mounting the archive, separated by comma or space.
   List of options: `fuse-archive -h`

5. (optional) `mount_root_dir`: Full path of the directory where you want to mount the archive. Default is `/tmp`.

```lua
require("fuse-archive"):setup({
  smart_enter = true,
  excluded_extensions = { "deb", "apk", "rpm" },
  extra_extensions = { "xyz" },
  mount_options = "nocache,nosymlinks",
  mount_root_dir = os.getenv("HOME") .. "/abc_folder",
})
```

## Key mapping

The plugin works transparently, so for the best effect, remap your navigation
keys assigned to `enter` and `leave` to the plugin. This way you will be able
to "navigate" compressed archives as if they were part of the file system.

When you _enter_ an archive, the plugin mounts it and takes you to the mounted
directory, and when you _leave_, it won't unmount the archive but takes you back to
the original location of the archive. Normally it will unmount all mounted archive files
when you use yazi >= 25.6.11 and use `quit` command to exit yazi. Or you can use a key mapping  
of `-- unmount` action to unmount.

Add this to your `~/.config/yazi/keymap.toml`:

```toml
[mgr]
prepend_keymap = [
    { on   = [ "<Right>" ], run = "plugin fuse-archive -- mount", desc = "Enter or Mount selected archive" },
    { on   = [ "<Left>" ], run = "plugin fuse-archive -- leave", desc = "Leave selected archive without unmount it" },
    { on   = [ "l" ], run = "plugin fuse-archive -- mount", desc = "Enter or Mount selected archive" },
    { on   = [ "h" ], run = "plugin fuse-archive -- leave", desc = "Leave selected archive without unmount it" },

    # Over quit command for yazi <= v25.5.31 to unmount on quit. For nightly yazi, you don't need to add these lines.
    { on   = [ "q" ], run = ["plugin fuse-archive -- unmount", "quit"], desc = "Quit the process" },
    { on   = [ "Q" ], run = ["plugin fuse-archive -- unmount", "quit --no-cwd-file"], desc = "Quit without outputting cwd-file" },

    # Or if you use project.yazi or other plugin that call quit command internally, just keep in mind to add unmount command before quit command.
    # Even with nightly yazi
    { on   = [ "q" ], run = ["plugin fuse-archive -- unmount", "plugin projects -- quit"], desc = "Quit the process" },
]
```

When the current file is not a supported archive type, the plugin simply calls
_enter_, and when there is nothing to unmount, it calls _leave_, so it works
transparently.

In case you run into any problems and need to unmount something manually, or
delete any temporary directories, the location of the mounts is one of the
following:

1. `/tmp/yazi/fuse-archive/...` by default.
2. Or if you set `mount_root_dir` option in `setup()` function, it will be
   `mount_root_dir/yazi/fuse-archive/...` in your `mount_root_dir` directory.
